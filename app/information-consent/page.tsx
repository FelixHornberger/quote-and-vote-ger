                        <p className="font-normal">
                            The purpose of this research is to investigate how Generative Information Retrieval systems can be used for information gathering on elections. 
                            The goal of this study is to analyse how the Generative Information Retrieval systems and the answers they provide impact the way people engagement with information on party manifestos and the amount of political knowledge gained regarding the EU elections on 9 June 2024. Your participation will help me achieve this research goal. 
                            The results of this research may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific proceedings and journals.</p>
                        <h2 className="text-center my-2">2. Study Participation</h2>
                        <p className="font-normal">Your participation in this online study is entirely voluntary and can be discontinued or withdrawn at any
                            time. You can refuse to answer any questions or continue with the study at any time if you feel
                            uncomfortable in any way. You can discontinue or withdraw your participation at any time without giving
                            a reason. However, we reserve the right to exclude you from the study (e.g. in the case of invalid
                            attempts or if continuing the study could have a negative impact on your well-being or the equipment).
                            You will receive the offered compensation even if you discontinue the study. Repeated participation in
                            the study is not permitted.</p>
                        <h2 className="text-center my-2">3. Study Procedure</h2>
                        <p className="font-normal my-2">After confirming this informed consent, the procedure is as follows:</p>
                        <ul className="mb-2">
                            <li>1. You will be initially provided with a brief introduction to the study. After this, you will complete the informed
                                    consent process.</li>
                            <li>2. You will be quizzed to test your knowledge on EU elections and the European Parliament.</li>
                            <li>3. You will be asked to choose a party that you want to learn about. </li>
                            <li>4. You will be assigned to a method of learning. This will either by a chat-based system [Claude 3 Haiku] or the party manifesto as a pdf document. 
                                Your conversation with the chatbot will be forwarded to third-party providers. 
                                Therefore, do not disclose any personal data in the chat and do not share any information that you would not discuss with other people. 
                                Only chat data will be shared with third party providers. 
                                All other data, such as demographics data and questions answered, will not be shared outside the research team.</li>
                            <li>5. After completing the task, you will be presented with a short questionnaire to determine what you learned and whether this will impact your voting intentions.</li>
                            <li>6. Finally, you will be asked to provide some demographic information (age, gender, level of education, occupation, political orientation)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p className="font-normal my-2">The confirmation of participation in this study can be obtained directly from the researchers.</p>
                        <h2 className="text-center my-2">4. Risks and Benefits</h2>
                        <p className="font-normal">In the online study, you will not be exposed to any immediate risk or danger. As with all computer systems on
                            which data is processed, despite security measures, there is a small risk of data leakage and the loss of
                            confidential or personal information. You have no direct benefit from participating in the study (unless you
                            receive 0.25 VP hours as a student of the University of Regensburg), but you support my work and help me to
                            advance research in this area.</p>
                        <h2 className="text-center my-2">5. Data Protection and Confidentiality</h2>
                        <p className="font-normal">In this study, personal and personally identifiable information is collected for our research. The use of personal or
                            personally identifiable data is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union
                            (EU) and will be handled in accordance with the GDPR. This means that you can view, correct, restrict the
                            processing of and have deleted the data collected in this study. Your entries will only be registered in the study
                            with your consent. We plan to publish the results of this and other research studies in scientific articles or other
                            media. Your data will be kept until you contact the researchers to have your data destroyed or deleted. Access to
                            the raw data of the study will be encrypted, password protected during the analysis and only for the authors,
                            colleagues and researchers collaborating on this research. As part of the research work, the data is anonymised
                            using coded identification numbers and then made available to the public, whereby no conclusions can be drawn
                            about individual persons without the researchers&apos; information. Once the material is publicly available, the
                            dissemination of the data can no longer be revoked. As no contact details (e.g. emails) are collected, the
                            researchers cannot inform the participants about further details of the study or about a possible breach of
                            confidential data.</p>
