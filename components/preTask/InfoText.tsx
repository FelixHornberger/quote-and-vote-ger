                    In the European elections, you will vote for a party from your country. 
                    The members of parliament from different member states join together to form factions according to their political orientation.

                    According to the Parliament&apos;s Rules of Procedure, a political group must comprise at least 23 MEPs elected in at least seven Member States. 
                    MEPs can only belong to one political group. However, they can also choose not to join a political group and remain ‘non-attached’. 
                    There are currently 46 non-attached MEPs.

                <p>
                    Groups can be formed at any time during the parliamentary term. At present, seven groups fulfil the necessary criteria.
